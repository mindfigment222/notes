Plato as a tripartite model of the psyche. He represents them as semi-autonomous beings, Eye (I) Positions, the Head, the Heart, the Harra. He talks about achieving an inner justice. Having them dialoguing with each other so that they are properly proportioned, ratio, so that we are properly religio to the world. When we get that, we mitigate and ameliorate the way our salience landscaping gets distorted. And because of it, we see more deeply into reality, and that affords us to internalize what reality is more like so we conform more to reality in our inner justice, and then the whole thing spirals in a virtuous cycle, anagoge, the ascent out of the cave. The point of it is that this anagogic process which is the core of platonic spirituality is something that satisfies two of our core meta desires. Meta desire is something we want anything that satisfies our of our specific desire to possess. One of our meta desires is we want inner peace. We don't want to satisfy our desires in a way that is causing internal conflict, anxiety... We also don't want our desires to be satisfied by what is not real and anagogic process not only leads to this opening up of the world and the opening up of our selfes, and coordinating of our selfes with and conforming to reality. It mutually satisfies in an accellering manner those two profound meta drives.

When we get locked into the propositions, the propositions appear opposite to each other. What we try to do is manipulate the propositions. Antisthenes says that's only "symptopatic" of the fact that we are actually disoriented from each other. Insofar as we are disoriented from each other, we are not contradicting each other; We are talking at cross-purposes.

Greeks had two words for wisdom.

Sophia: comprehensive understanding of the fundamental structures of intelligibility

Phronesis: how do you fit your cognition to a situation so that it fits it well.

Sophia is much more about finding things, principles that are context invariant.

Phronesis is about being contextually sensitive and fitting yourself to the situation.

Phronesis = Practical Wisdom. Its not about being angry, not being angry. It is knowing when to be angry at the right time for the right reason to the right degree.

The Cynics reject conventionality and they reject the shaming / honoring practices around it.

Purity code vs Morality code

Moral Law going together with Natural Law

What we learned from the Cynics is the importance of non-propositional redirection and reorientation - metanoia, that changes of how we notice things, of how we are oriented. Metanoia is directed to what really matters in this situation. Waking up people from their performative contradictions, to the differences between purity codes and moral codes, and that only moral codes are conducive to cultivating wisdom and responsive to reality. Logos is much more an exercise and transformative labour, cotrained with the other training of phonesis, the co-orientation with others. In between argument and agreement is this other thing, the ratio religio of co-orientation so that we can train together in becoming more Socratic, virtouos.

Points to ponder:
1. How can we bring these enhancements of the horizontal dimension into our practice of dialogos?
2. How does all we have talk about translate into internal dialectic into dialogos.
3. How can we integrate the platonic socrates and the cynic one back together. How can we stereoscopically look through these, opponent processing, and see more deeply the socratic figure that we are trying to internalize in order to practice following the logos.
