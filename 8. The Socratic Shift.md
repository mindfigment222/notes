The "I" is related to a "Me", which is actually a past self.

The deep interpenetration between aspiration and rationality.

An enriched repertoire of "I" positions.

Parts are perspective roles that have emerged  within the economy of psyche for dealing with types of situations.

Guards and Exiles.

Rememer: all strategies that are adaptive are also source of self-deception.

Target Guardian & Concerned Guardian

The Self: a ratio religio oriented to the whole of psyche. Seeks synoptic integration of the whole of the psyche.

The Self as an eye position that caused other parts to reflect upon themselves.

The Self is the throughline, the idos, of the multiaspectuality and multi-perspectiviness of perspectival participatory knowing that is going on when we have this eye (I) position. Or the Self is the logos of the psyche.

In that sense you are not only dialoguing with the parts. You are unfolding the musicality of the intelligibility of the psyche. You are following the throughline. You are gathering things together so they belong together.

Implicit learning works well when learning something of which you are not focally aware and in which you are not engaging in deliberate effort. 

Implicit learning has to remain implicit to be adaptively powerful the way it is.

The Solomon Effect

The Daimonic is the medium of metaksu, like Eros, love is inherently transjective, and dialogical.

The modern conception of the self was built round around regarding as sacred autonomy, the autonomy of reason, the autonomy of morality, self-governing. Freedom was understood too way, as opposed to older notion of freedom, which was a full participation. Do you not feel really free in a insight?

If we are willing to challange the modernity of the monadic mind, it opens up inner dialogos and the realization of our dialogical rationality and the dialogical self. And it empowers us to enter more deeply into dialectic into dialogos and orient ourselves profoundly in a ratio religio that helps us track the throughline to the Good.
