## Plato's "Theory of the Forms"

Essence - is a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for being something. What is an essence of a triangle? Straight sided, three sides, closes figure, interior angles add up to 180.

## Form & Eidos

The structoral functional organiation of a "thing" - that which binds all the features together into a meaningful gestalt. Known by Aristotle as the formal clause.

Eidos -> Aspect

Phenomemon means shining into intelligible presence: how it looks to me, how it is acpectualized to me while also withdrawing into mystery.

Educe: means to draw forth. This where we get the world education form.

Shining in to intelligible presence but also drawing us out beyond mystery.

Necker's Cube.

Eidetic Reduction: is a technique in the study of essences in Edmunt Husserl's phenomenology whose goal is to identify the basic components of phenomena. It involves imagining an object of the kind under investigation and varying its features.

Eidetic Eduction: the process where we are going through all the aspects, find the through-line through the aspects, and finding from all the perspectives.

Eidetic eduction of the through-line of multi-aspectuality is in constant codetermination, coarticulation, cogeneration with dialectic as a process of doing eidetic eduction for the through-line between perspectives.

In dialectic into dialgos with are usually talking about a virtua and people are doing eidetic eduction on the virtue, trying to find the through-line, going through the multi-aspectuality but they are also trying to find a through-line between all the of their perspectives. All those two are feeding each other constantly.

## The Good

The Good is the promise, continually kept, that the "Throughline" (through multi-aspectuality and the perspectives) will be there. 

It is the promise that is true to intelligibility, and that is trustworthy.

It is the Throughline through all the throughlines, connecting the three Transcendentals: the True,  the Good, and the Beautiful.

Wisdom is the meta-optimal grip and the meta-orientation, fundamental framing that draws us (educe) to follow the path of the Good as beings of Finite Transcendence.

Enkrateia: contrlling yourself because you are tempted by something you know is not good, resisting it

Sophrosyne: you are not tempted, fighting what is wrong, by what's vicious. It is to be continually tempted by the Good.

----

Dialectic into Dialogos should get us to the place where we are being drawn into the Really Real, constantly tempted by the Good.

- there is a way of turning the thingy theory of the forms into a way practicing dialectic
