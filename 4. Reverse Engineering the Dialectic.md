Last time two important questions:
1. How do we actually practice Dialectic into Dialogos?
2. What is the Logos?

## Inventio

In Latin, the word "inventio" means "discovery" or "finding". It is related to the verb "invenire", which means "to come upon, find out, invent, discover, or devise".

"Inventio"is a powerful term because it can refer to an act of invention as both creation and recollection. This makes it very apt for describing Socratic midwifery.

## The Horizontal Dimension of Dialectic

 Between people. Communion.

We can all it a communicative dimension. It is the dimension of communion - common union. The emphasis on communication, not as the transfer of information, but as the realization of "communion".

## The Vertical Dimension of Dialectic

Contemplative.

We can call this the contemplative dimension. It alters how one realizes and is oriented to reality. It is not between people. It is between levels of reality and levels of realization.

---

What binds this two dimensions together? LOGOS. One of the meanings of logos is to gather things together so that they belong together. But also so that they are made intelligible. So that they can come into speach, thought. So logos is that gathering together and that living intelligibility.

-- 

Horizontal dimensions can be covered by a Greek word - philia - a kind of love found between friends, or in fellowship.

Vertical dimension can be covered by a word - sophia. Greeks had two worlds for wisdom:
1. phronesis - your sense of how to appriopriately fit a situation
2. sophia - a type of wisdom, the ability to relate all to he levels of reality together in a comprehensive, intelligible whole. Getting in ratio religio with all the logos ontos (being).

---

Phylia and Sophia are bound together.

The we-space.

Philia + Sophia = Philosophy.

Recovering philosophy as a dialectical and ultimately dialogical, getting us into dialogos, practice of cultivating wisdom and virtue and fundamentally transforming and transframing our self and relationship to other people and to the world.

Stoicism is the philosophical religion of internalizing Socrates. And trying to cultivate the logos, your logos, to be in ratio religio to the logos of being itself.

----

Aspiration - is when you are engaging in a project of deliberate self-transcendence.

---

What does it mean that self in relational in nature? Self-knowledge is integral to being a self. We know ourselves through other people.

We not only internalize other people, we indwell other people. You see/know through other people. Distributed cognition. Most of our knowing is through other people.

Know yourself as a "knower".

The "Self" is strung between a pole of framed intelligibility and unframed (because it is the source of frame) mystery (nothingness, you can't see it, you can only be it, participate in it, strange beyond strangeness).

"Religion is the real self-realization of reality" - Nishitani

Philosophy of Illumination.

When we internalize, we take the world into our self-realization, and when we indwell, we move into how reality is Realizing itself.

Theoria - (related to Latin "contemplatio") contemplation, viewing, or beholding. From theorein: "to consider, speculate, loot at."

Contemplation - is a Latin word that comes from the verb "contemplari", which means to "observe attentively" or to "consider deeply". Contemplation is often understood as a form of inward reflection that involves focusing the mind on a particular concept, idea, or image in order to gain a deeper understanding or insight.

Reflect into apora: light itself is invisible, you can't see light, you can also see by means of it, you see through it.

Aletheia - A Greek term typically translated as truth or unconcealment, sense of things coming to light. For Heidegger, aletheia is not just about uncovernig facts or discovering hidden truths, but rather it is a way of being in the world that involves a constant openness and engagement with one's surrounding. Aletheia is profoundly transjective. And its primordial, and grounding and affords subjectivity and objectivity and their relationship together in what we typically truth, the truth we assign to our propositions and our representational level of mind.

--

Socratic questioning flows between shining into intelligible apperance with withdrawing back into the background. The logos flows between intelligibility and mystery as it flows between people and between levels of realization. Dialectic into Dialogos must afford all of this.

Dialectic into Dialogos must:
1. Take us into the non-propositional
2. Foreground second person perspective and the we-space.
3. Expose us to radical reorienting aporia and non-thingy thinking.
4. Have vertical contemplation and horizontal communion bound together by logos
5. Afford the internalization, indwelling loop that will spiral into self-transcendence and through the levels of reality, realization
6. Allow a sense of non-thingness of the self and the groud of reality, the no-thingness of being.
7. Foreground aletheia and tranjectivity.
8. Will cultivate finite transcendence as our fundamental orientation.
