Ways are we "after" Socrates:
- Like a hunter who is trying to catch a prey. We are trying to track him. Find the signs. Determine his significance. Leave our comfortable place we live in, and move into something a little less familiar and more interesting for us. Become as much as you can as Socrates. Internalizing Socrates.
- Catch Socrates like you catch a virus. Catch a virtual virus that is going to change the genetic code of your self and therefore how the world is disclosed to that self.
- We are going to catch up with Socrates. There is a sense in which he is ahead of us. In developmental way he has in many ways gone further than us. As the child is to the adult, the adult is to the sage. Try to follow The Way of Socrates. See how Socrates inspired people to aspire to being better than they currently found themselves.
- Reciprocal Re-interpretation, on one hand we have historical interpretation, on the other existential inspiration, we gonna make them talk to each other


## Imaginary vs Imaginal
Imaginary: imagination as fantasizing. We often use it in reference to someting unreal or illusory.
Imaginal: Imagination to enhance perception and insight. Corbin's imaginal world (or mundus imaginalis), drawn from the work of Islamic philosophers Suhrawardi and Ibn Arabi, is an order of reality that bridges between matter and spirit, the realm of imagination where we encounter the deeper patters of being. "It is a function that permits all the universes to symbolize with one another".

## The Self

The self is a model of environment. It is a way of orienting to the environment so that you can find you way in it in a way that develops who and what you are.

 Socrates doesn't have a method. He has a spirituality centered on the love of wisdom. That is his Way.
