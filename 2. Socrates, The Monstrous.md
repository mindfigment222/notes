Socrates described himself as atopos, which means "strange", "out of place", not belonging to any known category. It resembles the modern world "atypical" but is deeper and more powerful.

Metaxy: fundamentally in between the human and the divine.

Between human finitude and the transcendence of the divine.

Questioning/Questing plays a central part rather than concluding. This dialogues end profoundly inconclusively.

What is virtue, wisdom, knowledge, goodness, real?

Understanding awareness of how one is ignorant in this situation in a way that matters because one has been pretending, deeply, unconsciouslly, automatically, reactively to know. He has cultivated Learned Ignorance.

Following the LOGOS where it goes, like a wind.

Dialogous are taking you to The Horizon of Wonder.

### Curiosity vs Wonder

Curiosity: in the having mode. When I don't know something and I need that information. I fill it and then I have what I need.

Wonder: in the being mode. You can actually never reach it. You know what is wihtin your understanding and what is on the cusp and beyond your understanding. You are not filling a whole, you are opening to the horizon. You are calling yourself and the way you have framed the world into question so a new self in a new world can be deeply born. But in a way that you feel called to. In a way that is beautiful to you. Educing. Going through the labor pains of giving birth to yourself. That is to be on the Horizon of Wonder.

Wisdom begins in Wonder.

There is discipline to following the logos that allows us Mutual Midwifing, allows the logos to take the life of its own and thereby transform the way we are living.

### Elenchus

A logical refutation.

The Socratic method of eliciting truth by question and answer, especially as used to refute an argument.

In the hands of Plato it slowly become dialectic. A way of structuring dialogue in a disciplined manner so that will take on the features of dialogos. A practice.

-----

That practice can result in a process, Dialogos, which is not something we do. We participate in it, profoundly, like we participate in love, friendship. It is between us and between us and the world.

The practice of Dialectic, the process of Dialogos, the paradoxical state of Learned Ignorance.

Socrates claims to know erotica, he knows about the erotic thinks, how we seek to bind ourselves to things. He knows how to track Eros. Can you feel Eros so that you don't do all the self-deceptive, self-destructive things you have done because of that feeling. He knows what to care about.

Socrates knows the difference between belief/opinion and knowledge.

He knows how to track, follow, quest after knowledge in a way that is not just haphazard.

Socrates claims to be a lover of wisdom. Except this time it is not Eros. It is Philia. It is the kind of love between friends, or fellowship. People working in concert together. He knows how to work with people in order to be properly oriented towards wisdom.

Realise how much you really don't and can't know another person because of how really dynamically complex another person is. Wisdom and virtue are excellences of persons and you can never fully know a person. How could you possible fully know the excellence of personhood. But you can love it the way you love a particular person.

Wonder, love, the cultivation of wisdom, deep continuity of growing contact, they are all bound together in learned ignorance.

Socrates knows that the unexamined life is not worth living.

----

Socrates clearly and repeatedly argues for three things:
1. The best life is the life of Virtue.
2. Virtue depends on knowledge.
3. He does not have the knowledge needed for a virtue.

Socrates affords transframing. Combination of transcendence, transformation and reframing.

Socrates affords transframing. Combination of transcendence, transformation and reframing. Central to becoming wiser.

Socrates is like all the other sages who are paradoxical, atypos and strange.

Wriitten dialogue format affords internalization

Socrates is ironic. Irony is connected to learned ignorance. And in that sense it affords the right kind of internalization.

Inner symphony of sages.
