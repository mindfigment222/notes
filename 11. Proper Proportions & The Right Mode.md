Serenity Prayer: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference. 

Nominalism: a metaphysical view that rejects the realism of abstract object and/or universals (i.e. concepts that give particular entities their attributes, like "roundness", "humanness"). The idea that there is no meaning in the world, it is all projected into the world by language and mind. Facts don't have values, the only values that things have, are values that we project on them.

Prosoche:  paying attention to attention.

Prochiron: very similar to Sati. Learning things and remembering so that  so you can remind yourself,  you can bring it to your current cognition and that will break up inapprioriate framing and afford more appriopriate framing. Ratio Religion.

The Telic Mode: This is when the activity in sevice of the goal. Example: working.

The Paratelic  Mode: Gives us a structure by which we can participate in the activity. Example: playing.

Play is how intelligent organisms develop.

We have to get into the play mode so that we can get into the being mode.

People engage in serious play because serious play is how we engage the perspectival and the participatory knowing without making the full commitment.

Serious play and the imaginal are the rudiments of ritual.

Aspiration is central to rationality.

The View From Above is a non-inferential ritual of seriosu imaginal play designed to awaken you to existential moding and awakening you from a modal confusion. The view from above frees you from modal confusion and it frees you to flow with nature. It frees you to enjoy.

It is therefore opposite to addiction. Reciprocal Narrowing vs Reciprocal Opening.

The view from above is a way of enacting anagoge. It is a way of engaging in reciprocal opening.

Love is not an emotion. Love is an existential stance. It is a mode. It is a way of binding yourself in deliberately mutually participated co-identification and reciprocal opening. I develop through you, you develop through me, and we both stay faithful to that. I never claim to know you the way I know the bottle. I am only faithful to you in that I am constantly being drawn into your mystery as you shine into me.

Joy is a way of recognizing that you are in love, which isn't an emotion and isn't a feeling. In is a way of inhabiting the being mode by being with, through, and for someone else or something else, including your future self.

Ratio religion not only means the proper proportioning of your attention and memory, it also means being in the right mode.

Points to ponder:
1. Stoics add further depth to the vertical dimension dialectic into dialogos.
2. How can we integrate the vertical, emphasized by the Stoics with the horizontal emphasize of the Cynics.
3. How can we bring awakening to existential moding and awakening from modal confusion into our practice. We need to get into the safety framing, serious play, and ritual, organized around developmental needs. We need all these in our practice.
4. How can we bring reciprocal opening to our practice.
