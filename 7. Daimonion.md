Socrates seems to practice both outer dialogue and inner dialogue. He has developed a virtue (power for exellence) for inner dialectic.

Super-Sophrysyne

## Daimonion

Divine sign or divive voice within Socrates. That alters his course of action and how he is engaging in perspectival knowing, what he is noticing in his salience landscaping. Perspectival presence, there is a perspective that is other that  his current one that makes itself present to him in a way that he find analogous to seeing a sign and hearing a voice. His says this voice is very familiar to him. He had it since childhood. He says in many places that this sign allows him to practice divination and be a seer.

Socrates' daimonion is the "gravest of the difficulties we all have to face in out effort to make sense of Socrates."

Here is Socrates, the primordial hero of rationality, listening to voices, which is for us a prototypical instance of irrationality and insanity. How can those two go together? Why is Plato and everybody else around him, disturbed by this? They find it strange, but they don't think at any point Socrates is out of his mind. 

## The Socratic Shift

Modern Rationality vs Socratic Rationality

The modern notion of rationality is something like treatise. It is a monologue of premises leading to a conclusion.

Socratic rationality is inherently dialogical (within and without).

Modern rationality is monoepistemic: the idea that there is just one kind of knowing.

Socratic rationality is polyepistemic: there are many ways of knowing (the 4 P's)

Modern rationality is monophasic: rationality is limited to one state of mind. One state of consciousness, all other states are altered from that. All other states of consciousness take us away from rationality and do not afford or serve rationality.

Socratic rationality is polyphasic. The ability to go into altered states of consciousness seems to be required. Or at least it propels/causes a capacity for rational self-control and mastery over passions.

Modern rationality is bound to a monadic self. A monad is completely self enclosed unity. It is a one unto itself. It is closed in itself. It is autonomous. It is unified.

The Socratic self is a dialogical self.
