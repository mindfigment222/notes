Thick terms: In philosophy, "thick concepts" are descriptive terms or attributes whose meanings include some kind of normative evaluation or value judgement (for example, the adjectives "courageous", "generous", "cowardly", or "cruel").

- Relevance is not a semantic or syntactic property of a proposition. It is not in the proposition.
- Relevance is not equal to all of its implications, which are combinatorily exposive.

Relevance realization makes you intelligent. Makes you capable of doing of those cognitive things in highly coordinated manner so that you can solve a wide variety of problems in a wide variety of domains by getting you to ignore most of the information that is available to you. Is it not astonishing how powerful ignorance is to our intelligence. What this might mean for Learned Ignorance? 

The very processes that make us adaptively, powerfully, dynamically intelligent also make us perennially susceptible to self-deception.

Finitary predicament - that is how we are finite. But our capacity for insight, that is transcendence. Because in a moment of insight you actually transcend your framing. You can even get into trans-framing. We should be talking about recursive relevance realization (RRR).

With RRR we have self-transcendence but never out of RRR and its attendant finitary predicament.

RRR is primordial.

Everything points to relevance realization, and how primordial it is. How deeply below the propositional it is and how centrail it is to all of our cognitive agency.

RRR is to cognition what biological evolution is to species.

Orientation: primodial, participatory + perspectival

Optimal meta-orientation.

Optimal grip: mental fittedness to an environment which evolves towards an optimal tradeoff between all of the different aspects.

## Fundamental framing

The most fundamental way your relevance realization is coordinating itself.

## Onto-normativity

The "really real", often experienced in higher states of consciousness, that shapes what we consider to be true, which actions we pursue as good, and how we are attracted to the beautiful.

## The 3 Transcendentals

The True, The Good, The Beautiful

Relationship between RRR + Fundemental Framing + Onto-normativity/Really real -> that is Logos

"gather things together so that belong to each other", "speech", "reason", "ratio-religio", "formative principle", "really real, primordial connection, connection between how we make sense and how reallity discloses itself, that is the religious dimension of logos", "RR trying to fit us to reality, guided ultimately by the normativity of relevance realization, to the point of normativity, we conformed, ratio-religio to the really real".

Self -> Character/Personality Traits -> Community

Distributed Cognition has a collective intelligence that solves problems individuals can't solve. Most of our problems are actually solved by the collective intelligence of distributed cognition.


Logos is dealing with Eros, Philia and Agape

We need an orientation of ratio religion that properly connects us to the primodiality of RRR of Logos, and homes us to finite transcendence. Dialectic into Dialogos must do all of this things.

Points to remember:
1. the primordiality of RRR
2. the proposal of RRR of Logos
3. the relationship of logos to Logos
4. the horizontal and vertical dimensions of Logos
5. the ratio religio of logos that affords finite transcendence
6. how all this needs to be realized in dialectic into dialogos.
