## Neoplatonism

Neoplatonism is like a grand unified field theory of all of the socratic lineage, synoptic integration, that takes Plato, especially his ideas of a rational Socratic spirituality,  and adds to it Aristotelian science, especially Aristotle psychology and ontology and then adds to it from stoicism this idea of a logos to the logos, the vertical axis, and from the cynicism, the horizontal dimension and the moving beyond the conventional. Neoplatonism is going to integrate it all together and therefore it is going to take dialectic into dialogos into its ultimate form.

For Plotinus dialectic is an intellectual (noesis) journey we must pursue in order to ascend to the first principle "the good". So this is not about logic, this is about an anagogic journey. Dialectic is a matter of noesis, gnosis of the logos within anagogoue, with that reciprocal opening within the ascent. Dialectic is the study of the nature and interconnection of real being (ideos), such that one comes to an understanding of the intelligible world.

Reasoning and representation depend on fundemental framing, the relevance realization that is going on within within meta orientation and meta optimal gripping.

There is a logos deeper than logic. This coemerges with the intelligibilty of the world, recursive relevance realization and the intelligibilty of the world are bound together. They are co-emerging, co-evolving real relation. That's about the idea of the cognition being inherently embodied enacted extended and embedded. 

Plotinus is proposing that dialectic is about the realization of this primordial relevance realization and its alathea, relationship to primordial intelligibility and how they are bound up together. Dialectic helps us to realize this in both senses of the world, to become aware of and to actualize.

We can talk about cognition as being simultanously top-down  and bottom-up.

Generative model.

The same principles are at work cognition and the world. RRR is basically cognitive evolution. The principles that are constitutive of life are constitutive of cognition. 

Cognition is RRR and the world is RRR.

Reality and Cognition share the same grammar. They share the same principles of operation and constitution. Cognition and Reality share the same form, the same generative grammar.

If the intelligibility of the world does not conform to reality then we are actually in the grips of an abslute sceptical solipsism. Because if intelligibility does not disclose reality then what are we saying? That the mind does not touch the world? Which means scepticism. Which means I have no reason for believing there are other minds, solipsism. I am the only mind. There is on real world, knowledge. And it is absolute because I cant even know I existed two seconds ago because I am reality on my memory, and my memory is falliible, and ...

Real is a comprerative term. When I say something is an illusion, it is always by comparing it to something that I take to be real. Saying everything is an illusion is like saying everything is tall. It doesn't mean anything.

The fundamental grammar of intelligibility is captured in math and fundamentall grammar of intelligibility, making sense, is unquestionably connected to reality.

Plotinus reverses Descartes question. We have taken Descrates way of formulating the question as something that is unquestionable. Descrates question: How does the mind work? First epistemology. Once I figure that out I can telll you what the world is like. A lot of difficulties with that approach. Most of the main philosophical movements are trying to undermine the Careasian framework: pragmatism, phenomenology, post-modernism...

Plotinus asks the following reverse question: How must the world be such that it is intelligibly real to us? We don't start with the mind and then try to work out to the world. We reject the possibility of absolute scepticism and solipsism. Not going from epistemology to ontology, the structure of the world, but from ontology as grounding your epistomology.

Plotinus answer: the grammar of cognition and the grammar of the world are fundementally using the same principles. The grammar of cognition is recursively layered with top down  and bottom up movement. The generative grammar of the world is recusively layered with top down and bottom up movement, ontological causation between levels. Both grammars are fundemantely the same. That is what you need in order to answer platonus question.

What is it when we come to "know". We have a bunch of seperate phenomena, many things and we find an underlying shared principle for them all. Knowing is the relationship between one and many. Being is also many components, parts into one. A unity over many things. So the principles by which something is known, and the principles by which it is are again the same. Reality and knowing are one many. This is why the problem of the one and the many was the deep problem of ancient epistomology as opposed to carteasian problems of how do know when we know.

We have inverted neoplatonism. In Plato it is more and more real towards the good. We have more and more real as you go down. Reductive claims, that everything above is epiphenomenal. Love is nothing but a chemical process.

If we only have the bottom up emergence and not the top down emanation you face a problem callled epiphenomenalism. Epiphenomena is something that is an effect but is in no way a cause. It means something exists and is real and it has no cause or power, no ability to make effects, it is real but it is not actual.
 
To say that something is epiphenomenal is to say that something is real, but not actual. Actual means capable of acting, casually interacting, making effects. 

If ephiphenomenalism were true of intelligiblity and cognition notice the performative contradiction we get for science. We would say the only real level is the quantum level. How do you know that? Practice of science. Ontology in which science itself cannot exist. Ontology in which we have scientific explanations for everything except for our capacity to generate scientific explanations.

The upper level must be as real is the lower levels. Bottom up causation and top down constraint. Causes are events that make things happen, contraints are conditions that shape the possibility of things. Law is a constraint.

Reality is dialectical. It is the horizontal and vertical flow of logos. Cominatorily explosive. Reality is dialectic into an inexhaustibility. Plotinus is proposing that reality is dialectic into dialogos.

Conformity is to improve the generative grammar of cognition so as to better track the through line generated by the grammar of being. This is dialectic for Plotinus. The logos of your being  to the logos of being. That what dialecitc helps you realize. Dialectic into Dialogos.

So on one hand we have to self-realization of your cognition, your self-consciousness, rationality, and that is bound and intermeshed with the real self-realization of reality for its own sake. Self-realization and the real self-realization of reality are conformed, are at one with each other (definition of religion, religio).

The identity, the non-logical identity of the One is the Good, is the basis of ontonormativity, why we find the really real good.

The one is the ground of intelligibility, realization. And therefore it is not something that can be known or made intelligible because it is the ground of intellibility and knowing.

At the very apex of this whole journey we get to something that we cannot know, we can only participate in. We get to a place of learned ignorance, in the most profound sense because you cannot know the ground of knowing, being, the ground that grounds the relationship between them. Learned Ignorance has to be the culmination of dialectic into dialogos. This is the greatest of aporias. And it is the aporia that you must accept if you are going to actually be one, although you can never know it.

Deep connection of neoplatonism of christanity. Christanity basically merged with Neoplatonism.

## Theurgia

Proclus adds this to Plotinus. Think of ritual. Proclus bring out the ritual dimension of dialectic into dialogos in a way that is going to be taken up into neoplatonic christianity. Liturgy is such ritual.

## Points to ponder

1. Dialetic into dialogos is not just a practice. It is a way of participating in a principle in process of reality
2. This practice offers you a deep enonement, dialogos, by way of the logos, you participate in deep enonement.
3. Being one with the deepest of realities when we are one collectively and individually. This is a profound sense of being connected in from our depths to the depths of mattering, being connected to something that has a realilty and intelligibility and goodness beyond our egocentric concerns. This enonement is a deeply meaningful thing.
