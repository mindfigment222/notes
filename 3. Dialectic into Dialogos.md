Socrates is very challenging:
1. Atypos doesn't fit into any categories cleanly.
2. Monstrous, he threatens a lot of our primary categories and underdstandings of ourselves and how we relate to the world
3. Liminal, he is on the boundaries of our thinking
4. Paradoxical, when we try to understand him we got contradictory claims that both seem to be true but indermine each other in some fashion.
5. He makes it difficult to internalize him because he is ironic.
6. He does not have a method so following him is not easy.

## What is dialectic into dia-logos and how ones practice it?

Three plausible reasons or explanations for why the instruction manual on dialectic is missing:
1. The Importance of Apprenticenship. Perhaps dialectic is like plumbing. You learn plumbing by being being apprentice to a plumber. You have to catch it from somebody, not pick it up from instruction manual. Gives you beliefs.
2. Dialectic is a meta-practice. it sits on top of an ecology of practices.
3. The focus of attention was not on the practice of dialectic, but the results it produced: virtue & wisdom.


## The Third Wave of Interpreting Plato

 Dialectic helps people to realize non-propositional ways of knowing. 
 Non-propositional knowing is central to the cultivation of wisdom and virtue.

## 4 kinds of knowing

1. Propositional knowing - knowing that something is the case, knowing that particular proposition. Associated with semantic memory: general knowledge about the world, e.g., facts, ideas, and other concept-based knowledge unrelated to specific experiences. Gives you beliefs.
2. Procedural knowing - knowing how to do something. Associated with procedural memory: a type of implicit memory involved in the performance of different actions and skills, the memory of how to do certain things. Gives you skills. The procedural memory is the space within which we manipulate propositions. That knowing how to transform, manipulate your propositions is not in itself a set of propositions.
3. Perspectival knowing - where we transform, manipulate our skills, where we decide which of our skills to activate, coordinate, or which to acquire. That is what gives me my sense of situated awareness. What is it like to be you, here, now, in this state of mind, correlated with this situation. What is your salience landscape. What stands out to you. What grabs your attention? Knowing via embodied perception. It consists of seeing and experiencing the world from within a certain state or place of consciousness.
4. Participatory knowing. You don't have to know that you know in order to know. It is at this deeper level. Notice that you shift between perspectives. Where are you doing that? What is it that is affording, and constraining which perspectives you take up? How do these perspectives emerge? What do they emerge from? You have you. You are an agent. Agent is able to determine the consequences of its behavior and alter its behavior in order to change the consequences and bring about the consequences that it wants. That means there is a relationship between your agency and whether or not the world with accomodate and support that agency. Participatory knowing: finding agency within an agent-arena relationship; by being fitted to the arena, the agent is able to determine the consequences of behavior and alter that behavior to bring about the desired consequences. Associated tith a weird kind of memory called your Self.


## Salience landscape

The way a cognitive agent determines relevance through decisions about how to commit its attentional, metabolic, temporal, and behavior resources in a highly complex, dynamic, and self-organizing manner.

## Affordance
A real existing possibility for action.

Why  is the non-propositional so important? Non-propositional is the place in which I can fundementally transform the propositional, and also the procedural, and perspectival, and even participatory. That's the place where trans-framing can occur. The non-propositional it what's make everything intelligibly meaningful to you, before you bring it into proposition.

Notice how difficult it is to catch the non-propositional in propositions. Try to give instructions about how to tie a shoelace so that I can follow the instructions exactly.

Religio - to be connected, to be bind together. Meaning in life is how you are religion to yourself, to other people, to the world. Wisdom is about ratio (proper proportioning) religio.

## Noesis

Original meaning - noticing.

Noticing and a way noticing can generate insight and how insight transforms what you are noticing, what is salient to you, what you are considering relevant, how you are bound to a context (religio). Perspectival, non-propositional.

## Gnosis

How we deal with when we need to fundemantally transform ourselves and our world so we can be a different person in a different world. Its a knowledge that allows you to transform someone. Participatory knowing.

Dialectic moves us into the non-propositioinal so that we can cultivate the ratio religion that is so central to virtue.



Socrates exemplifies 2 person perspective. It is the perspective that only exists in dialogue. Socrates moves between subjective intuition and objective perspective to a transjective perspective. Betweeness. The second person perspective. There is a fundemental shift of perspective that results in a new orientation. 

Socrates generates aporia in people.

Aporia: a philosophical puzzle or a seemingly insoluble impasse in an inquiry, often arising as a result of a plausible yet inconsistent premises (i.e. a paradox). It can also denote the state of being perplexed. -- I have lost my way, I don't know how to move forward, I am stuck. Confusion in a deep sense of disorientation.

## The Forms 

The forms are something like fundamental principles of intelligibility and of being. The forms are the principles by which things "are" and by which they are known or knowable by us.

--- 

Dialectic takes us into the non-propositional second person perspective. It exposes us to a radical aporia and drives us into a fundemental reorientation to reality (trans-framing) in which we give up the priority we normally give to things (physical objects) as our way of understanding reality.
